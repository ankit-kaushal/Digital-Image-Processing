### Shading Correction - [Code](https://github.com/ankit-kaushal/Digital-Image-Processing/tree/main/Shading%20Correction)
Shading Correction is used for correcting the parts of an image which are having some faults due to multiple reasons like, camera light obstruction. So correcting the image for the required purpose is essential. So in this project we have used a faulty image of some rice grain and corrected the image. Various Morphological Transformations are used in this project to correct the shading in the image.
